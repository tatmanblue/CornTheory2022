Hey Dude: Oh yeah.  That happens to me, dude.  It sucks.   
Hey Dude: I should probably lay off the weed.

Hey Dude: Shhhhh.   No man.  There's none of that here.  We are all law abiding citizens.  Catch my drift, man? 
Cam: <laughs> 
Cam: So, I have this cell phone.  Its not mine and it doesn't seem to work.

Hey Dude: You probably need a usb cable and battery, from the looks of it. 
Hey Dude: Here, have this usb cable.  I got a spare. 
Cam: Cool. Cool. 
Cam: Do you know where I can get a battery? 
Hey Dude: You got coin? 
Cam: Naw. I don't even have my wallet. 
Hey Dude: Shhhhh.  Dude.  You can't be walking about without your ID.  They will throw you in the slammer for that. 
Cam: Shit. 
Hey Dude: Dude! You gotta lay low.  Be a bum, man. Be a bum. 
Cam: Be a bum? 
Hey Dude: Yeah, man.  Go digging in trash. Either sell stuff you find or maybe you will find that battery you need. 
Hey Dude: Becareful who you beg from, man.  They don't like that around here. 
Hey Dude: And keep a low profile. 
Cam: Ok.  Thanks man. 
Hey Dude: Stay chill, man.
